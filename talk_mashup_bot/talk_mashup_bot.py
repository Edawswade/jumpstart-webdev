# Twitter Bot Starter Kit: Bot 3
# ALA Talk generator

# This bot mashes up ALA talk titles to make new ones.
# First, it takes a list of talks from ALA Annual Meetings 2016-2021,
# and splits those titles into potential beginnings and endings.
# Then, it chooses a random beginning and a random ending, smushes
# them together into a new talk title, and tweets it.
